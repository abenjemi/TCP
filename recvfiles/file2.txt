ASCIICOD.TXT

By Aaron Priven

  This is a little text file for all of the novices out there like myself
who have wandered in on the world of computing eager for knowledge but
who have found very little. This is a table of the ASCII codes.
"What? you ask? The ASCII codes? Why that's easy. 32 is space, and 33 is
the exclamation point, and 34 is the double quote..." All true, except that
the code starts at 0. Well, I imagine that all of you have heard of "NUL"s
or null characters, and probably "NAK"s (which are used in Xmodem Checksum
protocol) but what are the other mysterious codes between 0 and 32?     
 
  Well, friends, this is your opportunity to find out. Because I am going to
tell you. Now don't get the idea that I have been in the computer business
since 1956 and was on the committee that invented the ASCII codes. I wasn't
born till 15 years after that and I got interested in computers two years ago.
I simply stumbled on this very interesting table in the VisiFile manual
(a very bad program marketed by the late lamented VisiCorp that came with my
computer) that not only included the number and two- or three-letter
mnemonic (a fancy "computerish" word for name) but what the codes were
actually intended to do! (Yes, it sounds too good to be true.) So I decided
to gift you all with this table.

  Oh, if you think this is stealing their manual material, for one thing
the ASCII codes are far from copyrighted. And VisiCorp is but a small part of
data in the computer-industry's (read-only?) memory.

And heeeeeeeere's Tabley:

17            DC1       Device control #1(maybe they ran out of things to do?)
18            DC2       Device control #2

21            NAK       Negative acknowledge (We heard you, but no.) See ACK
22            SYN       Synchronous idle (let's sit around doing nothing)
23            ETB       End transmission blocks (whatever that means)
24            CAN       Cancel (Whoa, Nellie!)

127           DEL       Delete
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The parts in parentheses are my own little comments, or explanations.
I still don't know what some of them (the codes) mean. The other thing one
must remember is that these were originally for teletypes and not computers,
so that way "Synchronous idle" and the "Acknowledge" family make more sense.
SYN means that someone doesn't want to do anything just yet. ACK and NAK are
in response to a question. ACK means "Yes, we heard you, and the answer is
yes." NAK means "Yes, we heard you, but the answer is no." Presumably if the
questioner recieves anything else then the questioner means "What?"
  Other ones that make sense to me but might not to other people: ENQ was
more than likely the thing people sent when they wanted an ACK or NAK.
BEL is a bell because electronic speakers on teletypes were not common.
VT probably meant "Go to the next vertical tab row" just as a n
